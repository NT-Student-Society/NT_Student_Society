        <u><h3>About Us</h3></u>
        <p>
            The Northern Territory Students’ Society is a student-led group that focuses on student well-being, recognising achievements and promoting a positive youth culture within the Northern Territory. Established by a group of dedicated students in 2023, we share a common mission of recognising student achievements and promoting a positive teenage culture.

            <b><u>Why are we doing this?</u></b>
            <br>
            The public perception of the Northern Territory has always been negative due to information bombardment about problematic youths in the NT. However, while the mainstream media focuses on the negative news that gains the most views and attention, the amazing young people of the Northern Territory have been striving for excellence despite having fewer resources and opportunities compared to students in major cities down South. By obtaining greater media attention for the young people in the Northern Territory, we hope to change the negative perception of the public, while creating more opportunities for the different students with interests in different fields.

            <br>
            By joining the NTSS, students will be able to play a leading role in making positive community changes and have a chance to take leadership roles in the organisation. Students will also explore career options while volunteering in the organisation and have the chance to develop their problem-solving and interpersonal skills in a supporting community. The NTSS also provides an outlet for young people to voice out on everyday issues, which will ultimately lead to improvements in their community.

            <b><u>NTSS and the Student Spotlight project</u></b>
            <br>
            In 2024, the NTSS is currently working on publishing a free local online magazine known as “Student Spotlight”, a magazine that covers the young talents in the Northern Territory and promotes positive youth culture by showcasing work done by students in the Northern Territory. “Student Spotlight” is currently looking for freelance writers (columnists) and voluntary journalists. If interested, please fill out the online volunteering form. By creating a powerful media outlet, we hope to directly promote the young people of the Northern Territory and showcase their talents to all of Australia.

            <b><u>NTSS and schools in the Northern Territory</u></b>
            <br>
            The NTSS is actively looking for support from primary schools, middle schools and high schools in the Northern Territory. By spreading positive influence in schools across the NT, we aim to create more united and positive school cultures in our supporting schools. To learn more about getting your school involved in our initiative, please contact us via email.
